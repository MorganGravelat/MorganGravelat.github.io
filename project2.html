    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
    The Hallway Project was my first coding experience where I went from having no programming knowledge
    to gaining a decent understanding of C++ and the Unreal Engine. This project involved creating an
    interactive environment where players could navigate through a hallway with various gameplay elements.
    It served as my introduction to game development and taught me the fundamentals of programming and
    working with a professional game engine.
